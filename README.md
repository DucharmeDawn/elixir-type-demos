# elixir-type-demos
Demo project for advanced Elixir type syntaxes (AKA the ones that took me a long time googling to find)

Project is structured such that each file has an `example` function that will show you what each type allows.
You can manually run `mix dialyzer` if your IDE's language server doesn't do it for you.
Uncomment examples one at a time.
